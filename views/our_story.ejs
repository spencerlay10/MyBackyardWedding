        <p>An idea born back in 2017, our family had been working hard that summer to prep our backyard for the wedding of a close family member...</p>
        <p>While stressful at times, we absolutely adored taking part in such a special celebration and sharing our space...</p>
        <p>We didn't think much of the event until the requests to host kept coming...</p>
        <p>Since then, we've loved hosting weddings, youth activities, and other events. We're SO happy you're here...</p>
